This exists purely to show off where dummied out text and voice clips exist in cutscenes. It's best used with debug controls enabled so you can slow the scene down enough to see them properly. In-level cutscenes and FMVs aren't included as the former is difficult to work with and the latter is impossible to display subs in.

The placement can be pretty bad, especially for long extra voices in short timespans and overlapping subs, but their order in the cutscene is correct according to the script. Furthermore, the mod only shows voices and subs that are already loaded for the scene, so a voice may not appear if it hasn't been loaded.

Some used subs/voices have been shifted around a few frames where unused ones overlap too much.
