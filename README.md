Thank you for downloading King's Sonic Adventure 2 Pack

This is a pretty big mod list, with over 300 different modifications made to the game in some way. The goal is to create a blend between two mantras:
"What would Sonic Adventure 2 look like if it were still receiving updates and DLC today?"
and
"What would a Sonic Adventure 2: Encore look like?"

A couple of instructions to make sure things are running ship shape:

First and foremost, you'll need a copy of Sonic Adventure 2 from Steam. While you don't NEED the Battle DLC for this pack to function, I do recommend it so you can access extra features

Next, you'll need to have SAModManager set up. There are instructions available online for how to do this.

Once you've got everything installed, copy the included "mods" folder into your SA2 install (usually under C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sonic Adventure 2 )

Click "refresh" in your SA2 Mod Loader


++SETUP++
While most mods can just be loaded in basic alphabetical order with no problem, the following mods must be loaded at the very top of the list in this order:
-SA2 Render Fix
-Cutscene Revamp
-Enhanced Chao World
-Chao World Extended

Additionally, the following mods must be loaded at the bottom of the list in this order:
-Car Scream
-SA2 Volume Controls
-Character Select PLUS
-Character Select MINUS
-Ultimate SA2
-Sonic Adventure 2 Re-Run Logo
-Sonic Adventure 2 Re-Run: Encore Stages
-Better Miles
-Skin Selector
-Super Sonic/Shadow
-Supersonic for Super Sonic
-Amy New Tricks
-Knux New Tricks


Step 2 in our initial setup is configuration. While I encourage you to experiment with these settings to tailor your own best possible experience, I'll provide the settings I used below:
=SA2 Render Fix=
`Global Render Settings: Black-Face Culling: Disabled
`Events: Force 4:3 Aspect Ratio: Off/Disabled

=Cutscene Revamp=
`Enable DC Intro: off {IF USING NO BATTLE MOD OR PLAYING WITHOUT DLC, TURN THIS ON}
`16:9 Cutscenes: on
`Enable Trial Sonic in Cutscenes: On
`Enable Amy's Eyeliner: On

=Enhanced Chao World=
`0 SECW Main Features: Auto-Backup: Enabled
`2 Restorations: (tweak at your discretion)
`4 Chao Garden Settings: Chao Garden Version: Vanilla/Modded
`4 Chao Garden Settings: Use Vertex Colors: Off/Disabled
`4 Chao Garden Settings: Chao Garden Trees: Vanilla/Modded
`5 Hero Garden Settings: Hero Garden Version: Enhanced Hero Garden
`5 Hero Garden Settings: Hero Garden Trees: Vanilla/Modded
`6 Dark Garden Settings: Dark Garden Version: Enhanced Dark Garden
`6 Dark Garden Settings: Use Vertex Colors: Off/Disabled
`6 Dark Garden Settings: Dark Garden Trees: Vanilla/Modded
`7 Chao Lobby Settings: Use Enhanced Lobby: Off/Disabled
`A SFX Settings: Dark Garden: Off/Disabled

=HD GUI for SA2=
`General: Title Screen Text Style: Custom
`General: Button Prompt Style: Vanilla+Custom
`General: Life Icon Style: Vanilla+Custom
`General: Item Box Style: Vanilla+Custom
`General: Kart Icon Style: Custom
`Options: Compatibility Mode: On

=Disable Upgrade Models=
For simplicity's sake: just turn on every setting EXCEPT for Rouge's Treasure Scope and Knuckles' Sunglasses

=Menu Overhaul=
Disable Pause Menu Tweaks: On

=Modern Button Prompts=
So this is entirely dependent on which type of controller you're using. Select your controer type and then select the button you'll use for the Action Button. Usually I recommend the left facing button, like X or Square. Deck users: use the Nintendo Switch button style for best look

=Physics Swap=
I recommend leaving this alone for initial playthroughs and playing with it for mission mode. I do suggest giving Chao Walker "SADX Gamma" and Dark Chao Walker "Heroes Omega" to make their alt skins more fun

=SA2 Input Controls=
I personally had to tweak this to account for my controller's drift. Leave this alone unless you're experiencing issues, as it's quite sensitive

=SA2 Randomizer=
If you're gonna use this mod, you wanna tweak the settings entirely yourself

=SA2 Past Garden=
`Use Tikal Theme: Off

=Sonic New Tricks=
Leave it alone if you want. If you wanna change around the button layout, have at it!

=Zen Garden - Dark=
`Which Garden: ECW Dreamcast Garden
`Music Type: Play Japanese Garden Music

=Better Miles=
Similar to some of the others, only tweak this at your discretion

=Super Sonic/Shadow=
`Unlock Condition: Beat Last Story
`Super Sonic Music: Random
`Super Shadow Music: Random

=Amy New Tricks=
Map the buttons as you see fit. But set Allow Bird to Random

=Knux New Tricks= 
Set all toggles to "On." Map buttons as you like 


As you're getting set up, hop over to the Codes section. Now you are, of course, able to toggle whichever you'd like at your discretion, but I suggest the following:
~Fix Chao Walker Cannon Upgrade Crash
~Fix Chaos Zero's Attack Aura
~Fix Metal Sonic Bounce Attack Crash
~Reduce Spin Dash Delay
~Rouge Has Air Necklace (turn this on after Knuckles gets his for best experience)
~Shadow Has Bounce Bracelet (turn this on after Sonic gets his for best experience)
~Shadow Has Magic Gloves (turn this on after Sonic gets his for best experience)
~Tails Has Protective Armor (turn this on after Eggman gets his for best experience)


We're almost set! But before we start up, we need to jump over to Steam. This step can be disregarded by Keyboard users, but for Controller players, we need to configure the Controller Layout a little bit to ensure you're getting the best experience possible.
Right-click on Sonic Adventure 2 in your Library in Desktop Mode. Click Properties. Now Click on Controller. Click on the underlined text that says Controller Configurator. This will pull up the configuration window for the game. While I'm working to upload the layouts to steam, if you want to configure them yourself, here's what to do: 
~Leave most of the controls alone
~Map "DPad Right" to DPad Down
~Map the "B Key" to DPad Left
~Map the "N Key" to Dpad Right
~Map the "P key" to a right stick click
These changes will prevent certain actions from not being accessible

With all that out of the way, you are now ready to start the game!




++Gameplay Changes++
-Chao world has been OVERHAULED. The Hero Garden has been given a lovely Station Square coat of paint. Meanwhile the Dark Garden has been transformed into a beautiful Zen Garden. But it's the Neutral Garden that got the biggest change, as it has been completely transformed into Tikal's Alter
-A Discord Rich Presence mod will now show your buddies the specifics of your play session in Discord
-Character Select is now a feature when selecting a stage
-D-pad down now plays idle level-specific lines!
-Mech walkers got a big overhaul.  Higher HP and ring count = higher speed and acceleration whilst running/hovering. [B] in air or on land removes all forward momentum, use [X] to keep momentum. [L]+[R]/DOWN on right stick in air causes fast fall. Lose 30 rings max on hit, knock-back heavily reduced and have instant recovery. No speed loss on turning whilst running/hovering. This WILL feel weird at first if you're used to vanilla 
-Alternate missions now each play unique music to keep mission mode fresh!
-A Physics Swap mod has been installed. Feel free to play with it to your heart's content! But turn off Mech Alterations if you're gonna modify a mech walker
-New Hunter Stage Piece locations have been added
-Speed Character movesets have been tweaked. Light Dash is now its own button, All speed characters have the Bounce Ring, Amy and Metal can Spindash, Amy has been given her SA1 moveset, and more that can be tweaked
-Similarly, Knuckles has also been given his SA1 moveset back
-Hunters can now equip their Treasure Scope with the tap of a button, and it doesn't turn off. This can be toggled in settings
-Tails has been COMPLETELY reworked. In a Mech stage, he will spawn in his walker. In a Speed Stage, he will spawn without it. He can now transform the Tornado with the left or right dpad buttons, switching to either Plane Mode, or Mech Mode, or even hopping out of it altogether. When out of his walker, Tails has his SA1 Moveset
-Sonic and Shadow can change into their super forms once you've beaten the Last Story. They come with their own special moves, and their unlock parameters and abilities can be tweaked in the mod's settings
-an in-game Skin Selector has been added. You can access it by pressing SELECT in any stage (this can be changed in its settings) I have added 188 different Skin Mods across the board. Currently, attempting to add any more will result in a game crash. I am working with Sora (the mod's creator) to resolve this issue. If you decide you want to add some more skins that aren't included, you will have to remove a skin before installing one. There are other limitations to this mod that bear investigating, but I will hold off until Sora gets back to me. Do note, however: Super Sonic/Shadow can only access this during the final boss, Super form transformation changes do work, but not until the next stage. Some skins are a little finnicky and may crash the game when you try to reload that character into the next stage. If this happens, simply go into the mod's folder, and delete the two INI files in Savedata. Skins will save once you leave a level. The "Skin Packs" will be listed below
-Mission 4's ranking is now based entirely on how fast you get to the end





++A few other changes to note++
-various texture and animation fixes
-pretty much every single song has been switched out for either a fan cover or a song from another Sonic game. A few cutscene songs have too. The full Track List will be labeled below
-"Encore" stage textures have been applied to select stages. These will be listed below
-Non-encore levels have been given a visual upgrade
-Eggman and Tails have been given Red and Yellow laser blasts respectively
-The menu has been de-cluttered
-The HUD has been switched out to match the one from Sonic Generations
-Cutscenes have had their English audio re-timed so they are no longer overlapping as much
-Cut lines from cutscenes due to a programming bug have been restored
-FMV's are now fully subtitled
-With Character Select Minus on, character selection will be skipped for Cannon's Core, for pretty self-explanatory reasons
-The full game's volume has been rebalanced
-Input detection has been fixed. This is particularly noticeable on rails
-Upgrade models will no longer be visible. This can be tweaked per model within the mod's settings, but best to have them off to prevent conflicting with skins
-Updated Sonic Team logo and main logo
-Tikal now replaces the default Menu theme
-The ranking system is now equivalent to that of the modern one. D is now the lowest, with S replacing what was formerly A.




++OPTIONAL MODS++
By popular demand, I have consolidated some of the previous mods into single ones to make it easier to turn certain changes on and off. Before you go toggling these, I HIGHLY recommend going over to the Manager Config tab and turning on "Maintain Mod Order" so that things don't get jumbled around while you do this. The following can be toggled to tailor your experience easier:
~"Rainbow Explosions" I turned these on to make explosions a little easier to spot. But if they're taking away from your experience, turn em off
~"Sonic Adventure 2 Re-Run: Encore Stages" I actually recommend having this turned off for your initial story mode run, as some of the stage visuals look different from their cutscene counterparts. Best to turn it on for replays
~"Sonic Adventure 2 Re-Run: OST" By popular demand, all the music mods, save fr the few specific to certain Encore stages, have now been combined into a single mod. If you'd prefer the game's original soundtrack, turn this mod off
~"Car Scream" If you're gonna use this, put it above Character Select Plus. It's just a silly mod that can add some sounds to the levels with cars (except Kart ones) but it can feel a little off from the game's intended experience
~"Character Select MINUS" if you're using this, make sure it's put below Character Select Plus. I mainly leave this on now due to the infinite-death-loops certain characters get when they spawn in certain levels they're not supposed to. If you wanna turn it off, go for it, but be prepared to potentially bump into more issues
~"SHC2021 Expo - Sonic Adventure 2 Full Story" This one's entirely optional depending on the way you'd like to experience the story. Turning this on will turn the Hero and Dark stories into a combined version of the story, with your selection being which side you play as during converging events like character showdowns. It also turns Last Story into a straight gauntlet with no cutscenes
~"No Battle Mod" Mainly this was used by me to test the content that you can only see in the vanilla version of the game, but some people prefer it. This will turn off certain aspects of the DLC to give you a more Dreamcast-like experience while you can still collect all 180 emblems. If you're gonna use this, head over to the config for "Cutscene Revamp" and turn on "Enable DC Intro" so the intro will be in the proper resolution
~"SA2 Randomizer" Please don't use this for your first playthrough. This is def a bonus for replays. If you feel like you just need to go hog wild, the Randomizer is for you. 



++Known Issues++
As much as I tried, this is a game from 2001 that has been ported repeatedly and now modded to hell and back. You may encounter some issues. And most of them, the best I can offer with my limited expertise is to experiment around with the mod loader.
That said, there are a few consistent issues I can specifically address
1: I'm not sure what causes it exactly, but if you play Mechless Tails on certain stages like Fina Hazard, the sfx get mixed up in the stage. It occasionally happens in chao world with random characters too. A simple exiting and re-entering of the stage may fix it
2: stuff like Tails' transformations, super forms, and the skin selector, weren't in the base game. So if you try to toggle them rapidly in game, you will get a crash
3: Sora already noted on the Skin Selector's page that Super Form skins can't be changed while the in-level transformation is in use, due to coding reasons. If you exit out of a level with a skin, then load into another, that new skin's super form will be the one used
4: Not all skins have unique super forms
5: sometimes things like trail effects may linger from previous skins into the default. Just toggle a few around and this will resolve itself
6: Not every character can beat every stage. Most can, but there are limitations
7: Characters not meant for that particular stage may not spawn correctly. In most cases, this just means that they may appear in a slightly different spot when you start. But in other cases, like Sand Ocean or Metal Harbor for example, The spawn change will put you into an infinite death loop. I've tested Story mode full through and never encountered any issues with this SO LONG AS YOU DON'T DIE WITH TAILS WHILE HE IS OUT OF HIS CYCLONE IN HIDDEN BASE. If you're clumsy like me and initiate one of these death loops accidentally, close out the game and reopen it. In terms of stage select, you'll just have to use another character. But in terms of story mode, continuing where you left off should reset Tails to Mech mode
8: everything installed accounts for playing the game in English
9: If you're using the Full Story mod for your story mode run, DON'T QUIT OR GAME OVER IN THE LAST STORY. The game won't be able to properly pick up where it leaves off and it'll restart Last Story Progress. If you do, I suggest turning off the mod so you can pick up where you left off easier
10: If you switch a skin around in Chao World, it may mess with some of the textures. You can tell when this is about to happen if the Skull and Pumpkin hat items suddenly look weird. Simply leave chao world and re-enter and all will be fixed. Or don't. The only thing it really effects is the Omochao specifically in the Race, and they look kind of cool


++CLOSING NOTES for v1.5++
Before we get to the Credits below, I just want to thank everyone for their feedback. It's really helped me improve the pack! There probably won't be any further major updates until Sora can break the Skin Selector's limit, or until some major game-changing mod gets released (probably MSA2). Future plans of mine include giving SA1 a similar type of modpack, though probably not nearly as complex as this one. So look forward to that!
