Disable Track Segments
1. Make a txt file named exactly "disableSegments.txt"
2. One per line write the id of each segment you want disabled, no extra spaces
IE>
01
0A
3A
Will disable 01,0A,and 3A (see kart_track_ids)
3. Save
4. Done


This can and will crash a ton on load if you disable certain combinations of segments.


Twitch Stuff:
channel: the channel name you wish to be connected to
oauth: log in at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to get your oauth token

MAKE SURE NO EXTRA SPACES IN THIS FILE, JUST THE TWO LINES!!

command Costs, currency rates, as well as points per user are stored in the twitch folder





If you are trying to use the additional voicelines:
Make sure you grab the file off github, I'll make it easy to find
Place in your mod's gd_PC folder
In the games options change the language to japanese, close and reopen the game and load the same save

For some reason japanese breaks which character says what so just stick to True Random voicelines is probably best
